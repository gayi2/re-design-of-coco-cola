Case Study: Coca-Cola Redesign — A Passion Project
 Overview
This case study presents a personal and creative redesign of the Coca-Cola website using Figma. The primary objective was to modernize the visual language, enhance user navigation, and create a refreshing, minimal aesthetic while retaining the iconic brand essence. This project reflects both my design skills and deep emotional connection to the Coca-Cola brand.

As someone who grew up loving Coca-Cola, this project was driven by pure passion. I’ve always admired the brand's timeless identity, and I saw this as an opportunity to reimagine it with my own creative vision, blending nostalgia with modern UI/UX principles.
